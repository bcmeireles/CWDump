# CWDump
WIP. Codewars parser/dumper. Retrieves some information on challenges completed and scrapes their solutions, saving everything on multiple markdown files in an organized way

It will create a `README.md` file with some basic statistics regarding your [Codewars](https://codewars.com) profile and hyperlinks for each challenge you've completed. As well as a folder for each language you have katas completed with, and a .md file inside of it for each difficulty available.
You can see an example of the `README.md` [here](/generated/README.md) and and example of one of the `.md` files containing informations regarding the challenge and your solution [here](/generated/example_challenges.md)
